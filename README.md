# Discord Zoo Keeper

This discord bot was built to automate the boring task of asking people to make sure they have the pirate legend title equipped when asking for the role in certain Sea of Thieves discord communities. It's new purpose is to be used as a muilti-module discord bot that ranges from administration to auto voice channel generation.

## Installation

I do not recommend hosting this bot yourself, invite the currently hosted bot using this link: [will be added later]

### Quick Guide - incomplete
Install python 3.8, I recommend getting pipenv and starting a new virtual environment as that way you can easily read from the pipfile. Once this has been done run pipenv install to install all dependencies, then enter the virtual environment you created before by running pipenv shell, you can then start the bot by typing python bot.py within the shell you just started.

## Contribution

I'm open to any and all contributions but if possible please open up a discussion, either via issue or with me on discord, about what you would like to contribute before doing so to reduce the amount of conflicts.
