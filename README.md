# Title Recognition Bot

This discord bot was built to automate the boring task of asking people to make sure they have the pirate legend title equipped when asking for the role in certain Sea of Thieves discord communities.

## Installation

I won't lie. I completely forgot to add a requirements.txt for the packages, and due to tesseract I highly recommend just inviting the already hosted bot to your server however if you really want to fork the repo and continue this on your own to make edits feel free.

## Contribution

I'm open to any and all contributions but if possible please open up a discussion, either via issue or with me on discord, about what you would like to contribute before doing so to reduce the amount of conflicts.

### Contact

Feel free to contact me on discord at: The Pandaâ„¢#9999
